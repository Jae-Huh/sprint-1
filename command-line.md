Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
  The command line helps you manipulate your folders and files just by typing without using a mouse. For example, you can view which folder you're in, what files there are, make new files or delete unwanted ones. It is faster to use the command line compared to manually opening the folders, create new files, etc.


List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.
  pwd: shows the directory you're currently in
  ls: lists all the files in the directory you're in
  cd directory: directs you into chosen directory
  mkdir directory: creates a new directory
  atom: opens atom
  touch filename: creates a new file with filename
  rm filename: deletes selected file
  rm -r directory: deletes directory
  cp file1 file2: copy file1 into file2
  exit: closes terminal
